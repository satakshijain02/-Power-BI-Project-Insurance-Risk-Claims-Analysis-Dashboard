I’m excited to share my latest Power BI project — “Insurance Risk & Claims Analysis” — built using real-world insurance data! This dashboard provides a deep dive into policy trends, claim distribution, and customer behavior to help identify high-risk segments and improve decision-making.

🔍 Key Insights:

📊 Total Policies
💰 Total Claim Amount
📈 Average Claim Amount
👨‍🦱 Male Policyholders| 👩‍🦰 Female Policyholders
🚗 Highest Claims
🏙️ Top Coverage Zones

⚙️ Tools & Techniques Used:

1. Power BI for data visualization and interactive dashboards
2. Excel for data cleaning and preparation
3. DAX Measures for KPIs like Total Claim Amount, Average Claim, and Frequency
4. Data Modelling to establish relationships between demographics, car details, and claim amounts

🎯 Objective:

To visualize and understand claim patterns based on car usage, make, age group, education level, and coverage zones — enabling data-driven insights for better risk assessment and business planning.
